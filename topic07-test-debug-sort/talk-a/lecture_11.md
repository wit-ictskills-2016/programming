Testing
Exhaustive testing of software is not feasible because the number of such tests is so great as to be impossible to perform within a reasonable time. What is possible, however, is the progressive construction of a suite of unit tests as the project progresses accompanied by test harness that allows this suite to be exercised on a regular basis and whenever changes take place to the code base or additional tests are added.
