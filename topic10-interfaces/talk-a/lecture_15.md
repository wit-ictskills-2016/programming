#Java Interface Type

In this presentation we show how to use the Java interface type to unify common behaviour. In doing so we are demonstrating a concept known as polymorphism, a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.

We have already gained experience in using sorting algorithms but found it necessary to rewrite the algorithm when we wished to sort a new type. We show how, by using interfaces, we may write such an algoritm only once yet use it to sort a variety of types of our choosing.
