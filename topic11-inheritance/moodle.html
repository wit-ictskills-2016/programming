          <p>A class may inherit from another class and in doing so gain access to much of its behaviour and data.  The inherited or base class, in addition to having access to its parent, may specialize by adding its own methods and data or customizing selected methods of its parent.</p>

          <p>An exception is a disruptive event that may occur during the execution of a program and if not anticipated and dealt with may result in the program producing incorrect results or crashing. Here we briefly discuss techniques to use exceptions to indicate the occurrence of errors during program execution and demonstrate how to catch or handle such exceptions.</p>

          <p>Inheritance is a powerful concept employed in object-oriented programming that facilitates solutions to a wide variety of problems. A class may inherit from another class and in doing so gain access to much of the behaviour of that other class.  The class inherited from is referred to as the base class or parent. The inheriting class is referred to as the subclass. Some or all of the base class behaviour may be used by the subclass and some base class behaviour may be overridden (redefined) by the subclass. Also, typically, the base class introduces new fields and methods.</p>
<p>Here we refactor the BlueJ shape project encountered in an earlier lab by creating an inheritance hierarchy. We create a base Shape class from which we inherit the other shape classes such as Circle, Triangle and so on. Polymorphism is used to display a cascade of different shapes.</p>

          <p><br>
In addition to exploring Exceptions, we introduce the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We examine the class <em>Object</em>, which is the root of the Java class hierarchy, and explore some of the methods in <em>Object</em>', for example <em>toString</em>, <em>equals</em>, hashCode and <em>clone</em>.</p>
<p>We also briefly explore an number of optional topics such as importing and exporting jars and using customized styling within the Eclipse environment.</p>
