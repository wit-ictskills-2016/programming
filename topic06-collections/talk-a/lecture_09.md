#More sophisticated behaviour

We discuss the application programming interface (API) of a class. We examine how random data may be generated. We revisit collections and examine the HashMap and HashSet generic classes.  We introduce a range of topics that includes two-dimensional arrays of primitive types, anonymous objects, chaining and control flow using the *switch*, *break* and *continue* statements.
