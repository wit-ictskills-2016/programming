Collections classes and control flow

We now introduce collection classes and control flow techniques to traverse such collections. Specifically we examine the ArrayList class and how to use the class to manage and manipulate data.
ArrayList objects may store user-specified data types which are designated as parameters when the ArrayList variable is declared. ArrayList is an example of what is referred to as a *generic* class.
