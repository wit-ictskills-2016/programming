          <p>We examine the rules that apply to designing a class and apply those rules to develop an application named <em>Spacebook</em>. Concepts such as cohesion and coupling in the relationship between classes are briefly discussed. We explain the approach that is adopted in the labs to develop the application as a series of iterations and examine the content of each iteration.</p>

          <p>Code without style may compile, run and indeed produce correct results. But code written without complying with a community-agreed style proves not only difficult to write but even more difficult to maintain. Here we present an initial approach to styling code based mostly on the rules laid out in the Google Java Style document.</p>

          <p><em>Spacebook Application (Part 1)</em></p>
<p>Acquire a basic knowledge of class design by designing and writing an application named Spacebook. The application initially comprises two classes, <strong>User</strong> and <strong>Friendship</strong>. <em>User</em> contains personal information about a user. <em>Friendship</em> facilitates a relationship between two users. The application is built as a series of iterations, each iteration being a standalone application that compiles and runs without error and that builds on the previous one, eventually resulting in the completed application. </p>

          <p><em>Spacebook Application (Part 2)</em></p>
<p>In the second lab we continue to develop Spacebook. A new class, <strong>Message</strong>, is introduced to facilitate communication between users. A <em>Message</em> object contains the message as well as references to both the originator and target of the communication. We gain further experience in using collection classes such as ArrayList. Both manual and unit testing is employed, advantage being taken of our previous experience with the JUnit testing framework. The lab concludes with a short exercise set. </p>
