Spacebook

We examine the rules that apply to designing a class and apply those rules to develop an application named *Spacebook*. Concepts such as cohesion and coupling in the relationship between classes are briefly discussed. We explain the approach that is adopted in the labs to develop the application as a series of iterations and examine the content of each iteration.
